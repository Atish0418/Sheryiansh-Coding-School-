## üî• Features

- **Like Button Functionality**: Just like the real Instagram, users can click on the heart icon to like a post. The icon changes visually when liked.
- **Stories UI**: Top section mimics the Instagram stories layout with circular profile images.
- **Clean Layout**: Organized post section, like bar, and story strip.

## üöÄ What I Learned

This project helped me solidify the following DOM concepts:

- `setTimeout()` for timed animations and interactions
- Manipulating the DOM using `querySelector`, `addEventListener`, etc.
- Parsing and using JSON data to dynamically populate the UI

I applied everything I learned from my previous DOM class into this practical project.
